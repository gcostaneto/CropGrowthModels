# CropGrowthModels

## Project Description
Some functions that I have been developing to implement crop growth models in R. The models are based on scritps originally programmed in FORTRAN and made available by professors FÃ¡bio R. Marin (ESALQ / USP) and Quirijn de Jong van Lier (ESALQ / CENA-USP ) in the lecture "Crop Growth Models". This project also includes unpublished functions, many of which are still under development and validation. Any suggestions, tips and help are welcome.

## Current focus

Some of the functions can be adapted for a wide range of crops (they arent crop-specific), that is, they are of generic use. However, this project aims to develop functions to support maize breeders, with emphasis on its use in tropical agro-systems. We will program routines aiming the prediction of the phenotype-environmental profile and its integration in protocols of genomic prediction and field phenotyping.
