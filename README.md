# CropGrowthModels

## Project Description
Some functions that I have been developing to implement crop growth models in R. The models are based on scritps originally programmed in FORTRAN and made available by professors FÃ¡bio R. Marin (ESALQ / USP) and Quirijn de Jong van Lier (ESALQ / CENA-USP ) in the lecture "Crop Growth Models". This project also includes unpublished functions, many of which are still under development and validation. Any suggestions, tips and help are welcome.

Fore more details, please contact <germano.cneto@usp.br>

## Current focus

Some of the functions can be adapted for different cultures, that is, they are of generic use. However, this project aims to develop functions aimed at maize culture, with emphasis on its use in tropical conditions. We will program routines aiming the prediction of the phenotype-environmental profile and, in the future, its integration in protocols of genomic prediction and field phenotyping.

If you are interested in this subject, feel free to contact us with a view to contributing to this project.
