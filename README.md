# CropGrowthModels
Some functions that I have been developing to implement crop growth models in R. The models are based on scritps originally programmed in FORTRAN and made available by professors FÃ¡bio R. Marin (ESALQ / USP) and Quirijn de Jong van Lier (ESALQ / CENA-USP ) in the lecture "Crop Growth Models". Some functions are personal adaptations and  they are in constant development. Any suggestions, tips and help are welcome.
